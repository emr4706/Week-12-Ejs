## Week-12-EJS

Hi Everyone!

In this section, we are going to cover EJS for html rendering with express.js. Basically, whne you need to show a HTML page with the data from backend(express), you need a template engine that handles this for you. And EJS is one of them. 


### Sunday Session

#### Lecture

##### What is EJS?

What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

Let's see some of the core features of EJS:

- Fast compilation and rendering
- Simple template tags: <% %>
- Custom delimiters (e.g., use <? ?> instead of <% %>)
- Both server JS and browser support
- Static caching of intermediate JavaScript
- Static caching of templates
- Complies with the Express view system
